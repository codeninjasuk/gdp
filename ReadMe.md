# GDP Functions - Documentation
This is a simple and intuitive documentation that the ninjas can use if they're stuck at a problem or have forgotten the functions learnt previously.

Forked from [@randomKeyss](https://github.com/randomKeyss) which was forked from [@JacksonHagood](https://github.com/JacksonHagood).

Encyclopedia for all of the pre-written functions within the Game Development Platform (Currently up to Orange Belt).

Each documented function contains a description, example(s), and further reference.

Functions have been grouped by category, and each category is programmed as its own page. The pages have been setup to link between themselves.

Green Belt content will be added as the tool gets used more.

This is meant to be used as an offline file  on student's computers. This will NOT be used as a live webpage accessible on the internet. The tool has been made in HTML for the sole purpose of making it easier for ninjas to use.

This is also a tool for Senseis to use when helping ninjas. Each location is welcome to make their own changes to the content.
